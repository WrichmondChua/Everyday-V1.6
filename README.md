# Everyday-V1.6
This is the 1.6 version of our Android game called, "Everyday". A lot of changes were made throughout the game and an additional feature was added, which is the accessibility of the lessons provided in the game for you to see and read.
And that includes the color code, which will guide the players on which of the following lessons are for Senior High School and on which of the following lessons are for College.
